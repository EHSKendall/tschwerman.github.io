Our unique perspective and knowledge about anatomy, disease progression, ergonomics will make a remodel more successful in the long run.  You may not need adaptive equipment now, but why not be prepared so that when the time comes you are ready.  It’s more than just looking up ADA standards, we as therapists at Enduring Home Solutions, have years of experience creating individualized solutions for our clients. Your home deserves more than a standard installation and we can help customize your home to your ability.  There are so many considerations to be made when planning for the future and we want to help you to make long lasting changes that will adapt to your changing needs as you age and live life to the fullest.  Don’t deal with your home, live in it confidently today!
