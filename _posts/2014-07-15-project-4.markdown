description: We partner with anyone who is seeking to improve their safety and confidence within their home.  We will serve those wanting to proactively prevent falls, seeking a more accommodating home, caregivers of adults or children with physical or cognitive challenges, and those looking to transition home from hospital or rehab.  Our process is simple! Contact your local expert and they will initiate a no obligation phone interview with you. We will then set up a time to survey your home to identify fall risks, accessibility barriers, and potential safety hazards with our comprehensive Home Safety Assessment.  At the conclusion of the survey, we will discuss available options to meet your goals and create an action plan to maximize your safety and confidence within your home.
